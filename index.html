    <h1>Fred</h1>
    <p>Fred is a strange creature. They emerged from a gumball machine at the local supermarket and have been roaming the streets every since. They're a friendly little fella who enjoys gyaru fashion and giving out candy to anyone they pass. Eventually, Fred wanted to make their own way in the world. They left their home city on a grand adventure to travel across the US! </p>
